	We put the script tag at the bottom for two reasons:
	1.	When the browser hits a script tag it will delay rendering the page until the java script is executed 
		so for usability if we put our scripts at the bottom of the page, the page will render faster.
	2.	If the Java Script is executed in the head, the body won't be rendered yet
		so we won't be able to manipulate our html.
	3.	Always put modernizer and selectivizer in the header so it runs first so the HTML can render properly.
